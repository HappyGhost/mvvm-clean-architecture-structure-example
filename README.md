# mvvm-clean-architecture-structure-example
This is the sample code to apply technology following points below:
+ Clean architecture (app - business - api) reference the clean architecture book by Uncle Bob. Here is the introduction about it https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-quick-introduction-to-clean-architecture-990c014448d2
+ apply MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) published by google - Using ViewModel, LiveData, lifecycle. You can view [guideline](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) for more detail
+ Data binding
+ Dagger 2 (which implemented by google) - implemented following dependency injection principle.
+ RxJava 2
+ Retrofit 2 and Okhttp 3
+ Navigation component of architecture component.
+ Sample writing unit test for MVVM + clean architecture structure.
+ Migrate to androidX
+ Kotlin android extensions  

The main purpose of this sample is creating the core structure to adapt different projects. This step is creating it and the next step is applying more new technology and some small projects to see how its adaptation is.
